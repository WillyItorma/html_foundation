  <h4>Learning Framework for Web Development</h4>
  
  <p>
    
    <strong>Framework</strong> for HTML refers to a collection of <i>pre-written code</i> that provides a structured and reusable way to build websites and web appications. These frameworks offer common UI components, layouts, and styling options, enabling developers to expedite the creation of websites and web applications.
    
  </p>
  
  <h4>Here's a more detailed explanation:</h4>
  
  <h4>What they are:</h4>
  
  <p>
    
    <strong>HTML frameworks</strong> (often combined with CSS and JavaScript) are like building blocks for web development. They provide a pre-defined structure, styling and functionality that developers can use as a foundation for their projects.
  </p>
  
  <h4>What they do:</h4>
  
  <p>
    
 Frameworks offer pre-built components like grids, typography, buttons, forms, navigation and more. this allows developers to quickly build website with a consistent look and feel without having to write the same code repeatedly.
    
  </p>
  
  <h4>Why use them:</h4>
  
  <p>
    
   Frameworks help developers save time and effort, avoid common errors and compatibility issues, and follow best practices and standards. They also make it easier to create responsive and mobile friendly websites.
    
  </p>
  
  <p>Examples:</p>
  
  <p>
    
    <b>Bootstrap,</b> <b>Foundation</b> and <b>Materialized</b> are popular examples of HTML frameworks.
    
  </p>
  
  <h4>HTML itself is not a framework:</h4>
  
  <p>
    
   While HTML is the foundation for the web pages, it is not a framework itself. HTML frameworks, on the other hand, build upon HTML by providing pre-built elements and functionalities.
    
  </p>
  
  <em>In essence, HTML frameworks streamline the web development process by providing a structured foundation and pre-built components, allowing developers to focus on building unique features and functionality.</em>
