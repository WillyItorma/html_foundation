  <h3>What is Cascading Style Sheet or CSS?</h3>
  
  
  <p>
    
    <b>Cascading Style Sheets or CSS</b> is a styl sheet languange used for specifying and styling of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). css is acornerstone technology of the World WIDE Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript. 
    
  </p>
 
  <p>
    
    CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation including layout, colors, and fonts. This separation can improve content accessibility;[further explanation needed] provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repitition in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page load spee between the pages that share the file and its formatting.
    
  </p>
    
    <p>
      
      The CSS specifications are maintainec by the World Wide Web consurtium (W3C). Internet media type (MIME type) text/CSS Is registered for use with CSS by RFC 2318(MARCH 1998). The W3C operates a free CSS  validation service for css documents.

    <h5>Style Sheet</h5>
    
    <p>
      
      A style sheet consist of a list of rules. Each rule or rule-set consists of one or more selectors, and a declaration block.
      
    </p>
    
      <p>Selector</p>
    
    <p>
      
      In CSS, selectors declares which part of the markup style applies to by matching tags and attributes in the markup itself.
    
    </p>
    
      <h4>Selector types</h4>
    
    
    <p>Selector may apply the following:</p>
    
  <ul>
    
    <li>all elements of a specefic type, e.g. the second level headers h2</li><br>
    <li>elements specified by attribute, in particular:</li><br>
    <li>id: an identifier unique within the document, denoted in the selector language by a hash prefix e.g. #id</li><br>
    <li>class: an identifier can annotate multiple elements in a document, denoted by a dot prefix e.g. classmate (the phrase "CSS class", although sometimes used, is a misnomer, as element classes-specefied with the HTML class attribute-is a markup feature that is distinct from browsers' CSS subsystem and the related W3C/WHATWG standard work on documents styles; see RDF and microformats for the origins of the "class" system of the web content model)</li><br>
    <li>elements depending on how they are placed relative to others in the document tree.</li><br>
    <li>Classes and IDs are case-sensitive, start with letters, and can include alphanumeric characters, hyphens, and underscores. A class may to any number of instances of any element. An ID may only be applied to asingle element.</li>
    
    </ul>
    
    <h4>Pseudu-classes</h4>
    
    <p>
      
      Pseudo-classes are used in CSS selectors to permit formatting based on information that is not contained in the document tree.
      
    </p>
    
    <p>
      
      One example of a widely used pseudo-class is :hover, which identifies content only when the user "points to" the visible element, usually by holding the mouse cursor over it. It is appended to a selector as in a:hover or #elementid:hover.
      
    </p>
    
    <p>
      
      A pseudo-class classifies document elements, such as :link or :visited, where as a pseudo-element makes aselection that may consist of prtial elements, such as first ::first-line or ::first letter.[6] Note the distinction between the double-colon notation used for pseudo-elements and the single-colon notation used for pseudo-class.
      
    </p>
    
    <h4>Combinators</h5>
    
    <p>
      
      Multiple simple selectors may be joined using combinators to specify elements by location, element type, id, class, or any combination thereof. The order of the selectors is important. For example, div.myClass {color:red;} apllies to all element of class myClass that are inside div elements, whereas .myClass div {color:red;} applies to all div elements that are inside elements of class myClass. This is not to be confused with concatenated identifiers such as div.myClass {color:red;} which applies to div elements of class myClass.
      
    </p>
    
       <h4>Declaration Block</h4>
    
    <p>
      
      A declaration block consist of a pair of braaces ({}) enclosing semicolon-separated list of declarations. 
      
    </p>
    
    <h4>Declaration</h4>
    
    <p>
      
      Each declaration itself consist of a property, a colon (:), and a value. Optional white-space may be around the declaration block, declarations, colons, and semi-colons for readability.
      
      <p/>
    
    <h4>Properties</h4>
    
    <p>
      
      Properties are specified in the CSS standard.each property has set of possible values. Some properties can affect any type of element, and others apply only to particular group of elements.
      
    </p>
    
    <h4>Values</h4>
      
      <p>
        
        Values may be keywords, such as "center" or "inherit" or numerical values, such as 200px (200 pixels), 50 vw (50 percent of the viewport width) or 80% (80 percent of the parent elements width).
        
      </p>
      
      <p>
        
      Color values can be specified with keywords, such as (e.g. "red"), hexadecimal values (e.g. #FF0000, also abbreviated as #F00), RGB values on a 0 to 255 scale (e.g. rgb(255, 0 , 0)), RGBA values that specify both color and alpha transparency (e.g. rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.8)), or HSL or HSLA values (e.g. hsl(000,100%,50%)), hsla (000, 100%, 50%, 80%)).
      
      </p>
      
    <p>
      
      Non-zero numeric values representing linear measures must include a legnth unit, which is either an alphabetic code or abbreviation, as in 200px  or 50vw; or a percentage sign, as in 80%. Some units - cm (centimetre); in (inch); mm (millimetre); pc (pica); and pt (point) - are absolute which means that the rendered dimension does not depend upon the structure of the page; others - em (em); ex (ex) and px (pixel[clarification needed] - are relative, which means that factors such as the font size of a parent element can effect the rendered measurement. These eight units were a feature of a CSS 1[14] and  retained in all subsequent revisions. The proposed CSS Values and Units Module Level 3 will, adopted as a W3C Recommendation, provide seven further length units: ch; Q; rem; vh; vmax; vmin; and vw.
