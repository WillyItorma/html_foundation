        <h4>Understanding JavaScript</h4>
        
    </header>

      <p>By Willy Itorma Jr.</p>
      
      <h4>What is JavaScript</h4>
 
  <p>
    
  <strong>JavaScript</strong> often abbreviated as <strong>JS</strong>, is a <i>programming language</i> and core technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. 99% of website use Javascript on the client  side for webpage behavior, often incorporating third-party libraries. All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users devices.
    
  </p>
  
  <p>
    
    <strong>JavaScript</strong>is a high level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard .It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions. It is multiparadigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles. It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document object Model (DOM).
    
  </p>
  
  <p>
    
    All major web browsers have a built-in JavaScript engine that executes the code on the users device.
    
  </p>
  
  <p>Examples of Scripted Behavior</p>
  
  <ul>
    
    <li>Loading a new web page content without reloading the page, via Ajax or a WebSocket. For example, users of social media can send and receive message without leaving the current page.
    </li><br>
    <li>Web page animations, such as fading objects in and out, resizing and moving them.
    </li><br>
    <li>Playing browser games.</li><br>
    <li>Controlling the playback of streaming media.</li><br> 
    <li>Generating pop-up ads or alert boxes.</li><br>
    <li>Validting input values of a web form before the data is sent to a web server.</li><br>
    <li>Logging data about the user's behavior then sending it to a server. The website owner can use this data for analytics, ad tracking, and personalization.</li><br>
    <li>Redirecting a user to a another page.</li><br>
    <li>Storing and retrieving data on the other user's device, via the storage of indexedDB standards.</li>
    
  </ul>
    
  <h4>Web Libraries and Frameworks</h4>
  
  <p>
    
    <strong>React</strong> (also known as Reactjs) is a free open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on components. It is maintatined by Meta (formerly facebook) and a community of individual developers and companies.
    
  </p>
    
  <p>
    
    <strong>React</strong> can be used to develop single-page, mobile, or server-rendered applications with frameworks like<strong>Next.js.</strong> because react is also concerned with the user interface and rendering components to the DOM, React applications often rely on libraries for routing and other client-side functionality. A key advantage of React is that it only rerenders those parts of the page that have changed, avoiding unnecessary rerendering of unchsnged DOM elements.
    
  </p>
  
  <h4>Angular</h4>
  
  <p>
    
    <strong>Angular</strong> (also preferred to as "Angular 2+") is a <strong>TypeScript-based,</strong> free and open-source single-page web application framework led by the angular Team at Google and by a community of individuals and corporations. Angular is a complete rewrite from the same team that built AngularJS.
    
  </p>
  
  <h4>jQuery</h4>
    
    <p>
      
      In 2012, <strong>jQuery</strong> was far by the most popular client-side library, used by over 75% of websites. While still in widespread use, its popularity has been surpassed by newer libraries and frameworks.
      
    </p>
    
    <h4>Vanilla JS</h4>
  
  <p>
    
    The framework-like moniker <strong>"Vanilla JS"</strong> is term that have been coined for websites not using any libraries or frameworks at all, instead relying entirely on standard JavaScript functionality.
